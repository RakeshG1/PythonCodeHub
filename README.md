## Abstraction

- Abstraction in computer science is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features. This allows users to interact with a system without needing to understand its inner workings, focusing instead on high-level functionalities and interfaces.
- This abstract function can be modified to include logging, error handling, or to apply multiple functions.
