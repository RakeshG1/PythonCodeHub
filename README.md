### Abstraction

- Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features. This allows users to interact with a system without needing to understand its inner workings, focusing instead on high-level functionalities and interfaces.
- This abstract function can be modified to include logging, error handling, or to apply multiple functions.

### *args and **kwargs

- `*args`: This allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments. The arguments passed through *args are stored as a tuple.
- `**kwargs`: This allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments (i.e., named arguments). The arguments passed through **kwargs are stored as a dictionary.

### Counter and defaultdict

- `Counter`: is a subclass of dict specifically designed for counting hashable objects. It stores elements as dictionary keys and their counts as values.
- `defaultdict`: is a subclass of dict that provides a default value for nonexistent keys using a factory function. This prevents KeyError when accessing missing keys.

### Major vs Minor Version

- The major version in Python indicates a release with significant changes and possibly backward-incompatible features (e.g., Python 2 vs. Python 3).
- The minor version indicates smaller feature updates or enhancements within the same major version (e.g., Python 3.9 vs. 3.10).
